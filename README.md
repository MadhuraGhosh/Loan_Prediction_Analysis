Load Prediction Analysis Using Random Forest
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting future load demand using the Random Forest algorithm. Random Forest is a robust ensemble learning method that can handle complex, non-linear relationships between features. It is well-suited for load forecasting, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets and incorporating additional external features such as weather or time-based elements.

Objectives
Data Understanding: Explore historical load data and understand key trends.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for machine learning modeling.
Feature Engineering: Create meaningful time-based features and external factors to enhance model performance.
Random Forest Modeling: Train and fine-tune a Random Forest model for load prediction.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
Tools and Libraries
Python 3.x
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing
NumPy: Numerical operations
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Random Forest implementation and evaluation
Joblib: For saving and loading the trained model
